# USTC AGI Time Series Research Homepage

This is the official homepage for the USTC AGI Time Series Research Lab, showcasing our research in time series classification, forecasting, and representation learning.

## Overview

We develop cutting-edge methods for time series analysis, leveraging:
- **Multimodal Language Modeling** for time series classification
- **Reasoning-Based Approaches** for time series forecasting
- **Self-Supervised Learning** for transferable representations
- **Comprehensive Surveys** covering concepts, challenges, and future directions
